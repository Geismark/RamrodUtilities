# RamrodUtilities

## Potential Features:
- Add word association functionality
  - Would allow for the generation of topical ramrods and WORDS
  - Would also allow for ordering of output(s) based on desired associations
- Add customisability (e.g. allow for words with repeated characters for WORDS)
  - Would primarily involve setting explicit rules for repetitions (i.e.: only a single character can be repeated, and at most 3 occurrences)
- Get auto-generated WORDS and ramrod(s) for a given association
- Function to determine radio clarity of words, as well as similarity to brevity/common callsigns
